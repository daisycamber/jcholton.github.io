             <p>The weather in Germany is less than ideal. It's often unpredictable and unpleasant. Today we found ourselves waking up to a steady rain which showed no signs of ceasing. After enjoying a short breakdast, we walked another 40 minutes back down to our bus. Then we drove to the city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich" target="_blank">München (Munich)</a>. It was still raining, so we put off our plans of touring the city and instead went to the Deutsches Museum.</p>

             <p>I really like museums, but I had no idea I would like this one as much as I did. The whole museum was essentially a collection of the modern technology and science that humans have accomplished. I am really interested in science and technology, so I found this fascinating. It would take too much time to explain all that I saw, so I have included photos below.</p>

             <p>My favourite part of the museum was the Computer Science exhibition. It included a lot of interesting exhibits and information relating to computer science, which I found fascinating. They even had an old Cray 1 Supercomputer, perfectly preserved.</p>
             <img src="images/museum1.jpg" class="ui large bordered rounded image">
             <p>After visiting the museum, we went back to the Hostel. Then we were given some free time to go and explore a bit of the city, and we did so.</p>

             <p><img src="images/me.jpg" class="ui avatar image"> <b>Jasper Holton</b> | October 6, 2015</p>
             <p>Today we first went to two castles near Füssen: Schloss Hohenschwangau and Schloss Neuschwanstein.</p>
             
             <b>Schloss Hohenschwangau</b>
             <p>This castle was fairly small by comparison to some of the others, and was the summer home for the royal family. Despite it's size, it was still quite beautiful. Below are some pictures I took around the castle. We were also able to go inside this castle, but photography was not allowed while inside.</p>

             <b>Schloss Neuschwanstein</b>
             <p>This castle was quite incredible. It is the castle that the famous Disney castle was modeled after, and shares some striking similarities. It is near the other castle, Schloss Hohenschwangau, but is higher up on a mountain. The view from the castle was also quite beautiful, with the jagged rock faces and hills covered in green and yellow trees. Here are a few pictures I took in and around the castle.</p>

             <p>After completing our visits to both castles, we took a relativley short ride to the town of Oberammagau. We didn't see much of this town, but we did go on a long walk to get to our hostel. It took about 40 minutes of upward climbing across a windy farm road, but the weather was decent so the walk wasn't unpleasant. All of us found this hostel to be the best of all of them. It was a small house overlooking the city with a lot of sleeping space and a large eating area. The place was also quite nicely decorated, and reminded me of a farm house. We had an excellent dinner there, and everyone had a few drinks. This made for quite an enjoyable night, and all of us were up quite late. All in all, this was a great day.</p>

             <p>I wasn't sure what to expect when I was told we would be going to an Island. Us being now in South Germany, there wasn't exactly an ocean nearby. However, on the border to Swizerland, there is a large lake. And in this lake is an island, called "Insel Mainau". We drove to this island in the bus, and when we got there we were given a few hours of free time to explore. Exploring was really enjoyable, as the island was full of beautiful trees, gardens, and buildings. One of the main attractions was the butterfly house, a controlled environment where one can go and see butterflies. The pictures I took from this island are below.</p>

             <p>When our visit to the island was complete, we headed to Füssen where we went to our hostel. We once again played games and talked in the evening before going to bed.</p>

             <p>Today I woke up earlier than I would have liked at our hostel in Heidelberg. After a quick breakfast, we went to see the Heidelberg castle, which has been quite well rebuilt since parts of it were destroyed in various wars. This castle was quite beautiful, below are some pictures I took.</p>

             <p>After our visit to the castle, we were on the road again for another three hour drive. This time, we went to Freiburg. Once we got to Freiburg, we were given a short tour of the city and some free time. I explored the city with a few other exchange students, and took a few pictures.</p>

             <p>As an optional part of my exchange, I had the opportunity to take part in a tour of Germany. This was at a little extera cost, but I decided to take the opportunity in order to learn more about this wonderful country, it's culture, and it's history. Today I woke up early and took my suitcase which I had previously packed for my fourteen days of travel. I then drove with my host brother to Duisburg, where we started the tour. The tour began with a three hour drive to the wonderful city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidelberg" target="_blank">Heidelberg</a>.</p>
             <p>Heidelberg is an old city. Thus, all of the buildings are built in the old style. I'll spare you the historical details of this city, suffice it to say that it is beautiful. A section of the Rhine that runs through the city provides an excellent place for ships of all shapes and sizes, and the old buildings contain various shops, all accessed by cobblestone streets.</p>

We all had a few drinks, and talked with eachother. I had the opportunity to practice some of my German, which I was happy about. I think my language skills are really coming along. I have a long way to go still, but they are already a whole lot better.</p>

                 <p>I'm done with the first half of my language school! My German is quite a bit better, and I am able to carry out basic conversations in German. I still make a lot of mistakes, as it seems to me that German is a maze of gramatical rules and exceptions, but it's better for sure.</p>
                 <p>Summer is turning to fall here in Germany, and this shows most in the frigid mornings and the leaves that begin to fall from the trees. However, the days are still warm and the city is beautiful. I have been enjoying spending time with my German friends, and I look forward to my tour of Germany that is coming up soon.</p>

I had the opportunity to visit this city during the afternoon, and I really enjoyed it. It was buzzing with activity, with all sorts of people going places near the city center. The main attraction was the Kölner Dom, which is a large cathedral near the center of Koln. This cathedral was built over a period of six hundered years, and is in the beautiful gothic style. Below are some pictures I took during my time in Köln.</p>

             <p>I am now continuing through my second week of language school. My German language skills have still been improving, and I am getting a much better grip on the grammar of the language. It's difficult for me, but the language school makes it easier and more enjoyable. Though language school requires a lot of time in the train station and a lot of waiting for the train, I still enjoy going to Dusseldorf every day and am able to make productive use of this time.</p>

             <p>Today I visited a water castle near Wesel. This castle is called "Schloss Ringenberg" and stands in the middle of a large pond and beautiful garden. Long ago, the water around the small castle was used for protection. Now it provides a home to a few fat Coi and plenty of auquatic plants. The weather hasn't been the best here in Wesel, but it cleared up today and I was able to take some nice pictures of the water castle and the surrounding area, as well as some with my host parents.</p>

             <p>After visiting this castle, we went to the small city of Xanten, just accross the Rhine from Wesel. We visited the Cathedral and the town center, and I learned from my host family about some of the history of this city. Near the city is a large archeological site which used to be a camp for Romans during the Roman Empire. The camp was abandoned long ago, but many artifacts continue to be found here. I found it very interesting how much history is in this Area, coming from Faribanks, AK which was founded not much more than 100 years ago.</p>

             <p><img src="images/me.jpg" class="ui avatar image"> <b>Jasper Holton</b> | August 31, 2015</p>
                 <p>As I neared the end of my third week in Germany, it came time for me to go to a much anticipated event: The Rotex Welcome Weekend, where all of the exchange students from across this district of Germany meet up and talk about their exchange so far.</p>

                 <p>(Above) Pictures from the welcome weekend</p>
                 <p>There were over 60 exchange students in the district, and we all met up on Saturday morning in the city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mettmann" target="_blank">Mettmann</a>. We all met eachother, speaking largley Spanish, German and English. There were exchange students from all over the world, some of them who had been here for months already and some, like me, who were in their second or third week. We went to a museum in Mettmann, visited a swimming pool, and went to a festival in the evening. Then we stayed up until two in the morning playing games, dancing, conversing with eachother, and having a good time. We slept for a short while, and then (with some difficulty) awoke and said our goodbyes. It was sad to be returning back to my host city after meeting all these wonderful people, but I also will now be able to meet up with many of them again now that I have met them. Today I got what is known as a <a href="http://www.rheinbahn.de/tickets/uebersicht/Seiten/SchokoTicket.aspx" target="_blank">SchockoTicket</a>, which allows me to travel around in this area of Germany using the widley available public transport system.</p>

                 <p>After two weeks of German school, I quickly realized that I wasn't going to learn much at school before improving my German language skills. However, I still really enjoyed school because I was making new friends and having fun doing various activites even if I didn't understand much. Now, I am giving up school for a few weeks to take part in <a href="http://idaf-duesseldorf.de/?lang=en" target="_blank">IDaF</a>, an intensive German language school located in Dusseldorf. I get to Dusseldorf from Wesel by train, which is about an hour of travel each way. The language school starts at 9:00 and goes until 1:00 in the afternoon, and is very engaging and fun. Today was my first day at the language school, and I really enjoyed it. Though I was placed in a class slightly below my level, I can tell that in this school I will learn fast and well. I am very happy to be learning German more quickly, as this will allow me to better integrate with the culture and understand my school better. I will attend this language school daily for the next few months in replacement of normal school, but I will still take part in after school activities such as Orchestra.</p>

             <p><img src="images/me.jpg" class="ui avatar image"> <b>Jasper Holton</b> | August 22, 2015</p>
                 <p>Surviving my first week of school turned out to not be as difficult as I thought. I was lost in many of my classes, but in some I am actually beginning to understand the material as my knowledge of German improves. I have been making new friends in and out of school, and having a really good time here in Wesel. This weekend there is a yearly airshow, where many small planes are shown off at the small, grassy runway strip near the Rhine. Among the planes were many skidivers, and I enjoyed watching them tumble through the air before gracefully gliding down to the ground.</p>
