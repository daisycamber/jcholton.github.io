            <p>This page contains a series of personal essays, with the newest being first and the oldest being last. It would be best to read these in chronological order. These personal essays are similar to some sort of blog post, and I will continue to update them as time permits.</p>

            <h2 class="ui header">Moving Out</h2>
            <p><img src="images/me.jpg" class="ui avatar image"> <b>Jasper Holton</b> | August 5, 2015</p>
            <p>For me, leaving the country for a year doesn't just mean packing up my bags and tidying up my room. When I come back to Alaska next summer, I won't have a house to come back to. My father took a new job in Hawaii, and we have a house there which my parents will be staying in. My sister moved out of the house several days ago, and now lives with a roommate in a cabin near the University. Where does this leave the house I live in now, which I have lived in for over a decade?</p>
            <img src="images/holtonhouse1.jpg" class="ui large bordered rounded image">
            <p>This house is going to renters on the 13th of August, just a few days after I leave town. That means that as I pack up my bags to leave, I also have to pack all of my posessions into boxes to put into storage. I have also been getting rid of some of my posessions, and minimizing what I have so I can be ready to take it with me. It feels weird to look at all of my posessions and wonder if they really have value to me, and if they are really worth keeping.</p>
            <img src="images/holtonhouse2.jpg" class="ui large bordered rounded image">
            <p>Despite this, I'm not going to get too sentimental. This house is my childhood home, but I understand the importance of moving on. Otherwise, there's not too much left to do before I leave town. I've got to get a few things together and finish packing, but aside from that I am ready to go.</p>

            <h2 class="ui header">One Week Left</h2>
            <p><img src="images/me.jpg" class="ui avatar image"> <b>Jasper Holton</b> | August 3, 2015</p>
            <p>Looking back, a lot comes to mind when I think of why I decided to go on exchange. I have thought about being an exchange student since I was in middle school. I thought it would be fun to do it, just for the experience. I was fascinated by the stories told by other exchange students, and I also liked the idea that it was an opportunity to connect with another culture. I also liked the challenge of it, learning a new language and integrating into a new culture. And to me, it seemed like a year where I could have a good time and get a chance to reflect on my life and figure out where I am going. But as the days get closer to my departure, I know it will be so much more than that.</p>
            <p>In the fall of 2014, I put in an application with Rotary Youth Exchange. I was very excited and nervous to hear back- going on exchange meant a lot to me, and I really wanted Rotary to accept me. I saw it as the best program that was available to me, and I liked the aspect of having a Rotary club manage the exchange. It turned out that the Rotaty people liked me, and I they accepted me into the program. The interview was a bit scary, but I did do well and I was able to answer all of their questions. After my acceptance, I went through a series of many meetings to prepare for the exchange. I enjoyed these meetings, and some of them even involved staying at hotels in Anchorage and hanging out with other exchange students. I met a lot of great people through these meetings, and had a lot of fun. Here are a couple of pictures.

            <img src="images/rotary2.jpg" class="ui large bordered rounded image">
            <p>During one of the meetings I addressed above, I was interviewed to be placed in one of the many countries Rotary sends students to. I was delighted to hear that I was to be sent to Germany. A few weeks later, I was contacted by my host family, who lived in a beautiful small town in northwestern Germany. This town is called Wesel. A week from now, that is where I will be staying. And I will stay there for a whole year.
            </p>
            <p>Anyway, going on to address the title. Why does this blog say one week left? That is because it is one week before I leave. Today is Monday, August 3. I leave on the morning of the 10th, not less than one week away. I have some knowledge of the German language to back myself up with, but I am going to need a lot more to hold up there. Hopefully I will pick up the language fast when I am there, they always say that immersion is a quick way to learn. But I intend to work very hard on the language, and especially in the upcoming week improve my skills.
            </p>

               I'm going to miss my friends here in Fairbanks. And I'm going to miss my home. But I know this year will be worth it. I look forward to the challenge and I cannot wait for the experience. And the fact is, when 1:25 AM comes around on the 10th of August, and I step on to that plane, I'm not going to look back.
