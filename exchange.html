             <p><img src="images/me.jpg" class="ui avatar image"> <b>Jasper Holton</b> | October 16, 2015</p>
             <p>We woke up early for our last day of the tour, much to the protest of the very tired partiers of the night before. We were on the road at 8:30, and we drove directly to Münster, only stopping along the way for food. We said our goodbyes to those who lived near Münster, and then continued on to Duisburg where the greater portion of us live. We were sad to part ways after having such a great time together, but it won't be long until we see eachother again.</p>
             <p>I rode the train back to Wesel, where I found myself with a 20 minute walk home in the rain. Luckily one of my souveneirs from berlin happend to be an Umbrella, so I managed to deflect most of the weather and got home safe and dry.</p>
             <p>Deutschland tour is now over, but what I took from it lives on. I brought back with me many great memories, experiences, friendships, and photographs. And I have essays here as well. While I know my exchange has many more great things in store for me, this tour is certainly something I will not forget.</p>
             <p>As it is only now that I have received them, I have placed below all of the group pictures we took through the trip. Thanks to all of you for being an awesome tour group!</p>

             <p>We began our day with a short tour of the city and the harbor.</p>
             <img src="images/.jpg" class="ui large bordered rounded image">
             <img src="images/.jpg" class="ui large bordered rounded image">
             <p>After this short tour, we walked a short ways to the "Miniatur Wunderland". This is essentially a series of hyperrealistic models of cities in Germany and other parts of the world. It happens to be the largest model railroad in the world. Being a model railroad kind of guy, I really loved this place. Everything moved, from the trains to the cars to the planes. You will notice in the photos below that there was even a day/night cycle, with the lights turning dark for the night. It was really well done.</p>

             <p>We spent several hours in the Miniatur Wunderland, before continuing on with our tour of the city.</p>

             <p>We then continued to tour the city, and spent some time in the Rathaus. While the city was really nice, the weather was unfortunatley not so nice. Still, it was quite enjoyable.</p>

             <img src="images/.jpg" class="ui large bordered rounded image">
             <p>I might have mentioned this before, but Rotex (our tour organizers) made a rule that for each minute we were late, we would be required to pay one euro. They also made us pay 15 euros any time we were caught in groups of less than three. They pooled this money (of which I made a three euro contribution for my accidentally slightly longer stay at the East Side Gallery) and saved it for our last night of the tour. That night happened to be on this day. Rotex took us with our bus to a small bar in Hamburg, where they bought us drinks with the money we paid them for our lateness. We enjoyed our time at the bar, and reflected on our experiences over the course of the tour. We didn't go back with the bus, and instead walked to the train station and took two trains to get back to our hostel. This made for quite a long walk, but it seemed that this was a logical decision for Rotex and our bus driver because they weren't keen to have anyone vomiting on the bus. Fortunatley, we didn't run into this problem and all got back to the hostel just fine.</p>

             <p>Today we woke up early and began our long drive to our final tour destination, Hamburg. However, we didn't go directly to Hamburg. Instead, we took a break in the middle to explore a little bit of Schwerin. The castle here was really incredible, and we were able to explore the inside and some of the area around it. However, we weren't allowed to take any pictures inside the castle. The pictures I got really don't do it justice, but it was a really nice castle.</p>
             <img src="images/.jpg" class="ui large bordered rounded image">
             <img src="images/.jpg" class="ui large bordered rounded image">
             <p>After our time in Schwerin, we continued our drive to Hamburg. When we got there, we were given some time to unwind in a large park. We all enjoyed it, but our time was cut short as it began to rain. We met and drove with our bus to the Hauptkirche in Hamburg, where we had some time to walk around this fabulous church and take photos.</p>

             <p></p>
             <p>After this, we went to our Hostel, had dinner, and settled into our rooms. We then were given some free time to walk around outside of our hostel, and I sat with a group of other exchange students in a nearby park, talking and enjoying the evening. We went back to the hostel at around 11 and went to bed.</p>

             <p>We continued our tour of Berlin today. We walked around and looked at some of the famous sites, including the Brandenburger Gate and the holocaust memorial. The Brandenburger gate is one of the most famous sites in Germany, and is on the back of the 20 Euro cent coin.</p>
             <img src="images/.jpg" class="ui large bordered rounded image">
             <img src="images/.jpg" class="ui large bordered rounded image">
             <p>The Holocaust memorial is a series of concrete blocks that are all put together. They symbolize the ashes of the people who were killed during the Holocaust.</p>
             <img src="images/.jpg" class="ui large bordered rounded image">
             <img src="images/.jpg" class="ui large bordered rounded image">
             <p>After visiting the memorial, we went to the U.S. Checkpoint Charlie (Checkpoint C) which was an important point along the Berlin wall. This was where people could cross between the area of Germany under American control and the area under Soviet control.</p>
             <p>We went on to visit more interesting sites in Berlin, including the Berlin Concert hall and the Berlin Dom (Cathedral).</p>
             <p>Then we went back to the hostel and had a bit of free time to relax. We were given 10 euros each for dinner, and we went out and got our food in groups. We then met back at the Hostel and walked to the Brandenburg Gate, which was lit up really nicley. We watched the show for a few minutes, which consisted of music and many interesting animations on the gate. Photos, and a video are below.</p>
             <p>We then walked to the Parliment building where we were given a tour and a short lecture about the building and the government. We were given some time to explore in the building, which was really nice. All of the architecture was modern and really beautiful.</p>
             <p>After exploring the building, we took a bus back to the Hostel and went to sleep.</p>

             <p>We were given a bit more time to sleep today, which was nice. We woke up, packed, had breakfast and then boarded our bus for the drive to this nation's beautiful and historic capital of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin" target="_blank">Berlin</a>. In Berlin, we drove around and saw some of the major sites in the city via our bus.</p>

             <p>One of my favourite parts about this tour was the East Side Gallery, which is a gallery of street art. It has many truly beautiful pieces of art which are famous across the world.</p>

After finishing dinner, we went to a beautiful light show where massive projectors projected art onto some of the famous buildings in Berlin. Below are some of the best displays.</p>

             <p>Today was our second day in Dresden. We had another tour of the city, and once again more free time to explore the city. Today was dreadfully cold for many of the exchange students. It was about 0 Celsius, which for me doesn't seem bad at all, but for many of the exchange students coming from other countries it was much colder than they are used to. Despite the cold, we all had a good time and enjoyed this beautiful city. Naturally, pictures are below.</p>

             <p>After our free time, we met and were all picked up by our bus driver. We took a short drive to the Meisen Porcelain factory. This factory was the first making porcelain in all of Europe, and does it incredibly well. Everything they make is handmade and hand painted. And all of it is way beyond anything I can afford. A little teacup? Five hundered euros. A nice little plate? Nine hundered. A little angel statue? Two thousand. Despite this, it was nice to look around and take some pictures. These people really know their stuff when it comes to Porcelain.</p>

             <p>After touring the museum and workshop, we visited the gift shop. I was thinking some nice porcelain from a historic place would make a great present, but once again I discovered that the cheapest little bit of porcelain costs 30 euros, which is way beyond my price range. So instead we headed back out into the cold day, now a bit warmer after a good few hours of sunshine. We drove back to our hostel where we had dinner, and then some free time to prepare for the talent show that the tour organizers were putting on for us. I decided to make an attempt to sing "Here's a Health to the Company", which I found to be a very fitting song for our tour group. I even got my audience to join me for the Chorous, which was really wonderful.</p>
             <p></p>
             <p>After the talent show, which proved to be equal parts hastily prepared and hilarious, we all went to sleep.</p>

             <p>Today we woke up to a pleasantly cool morning in Rothenberg. We toured the city again for a few hours in the morning, and walked around the outside wall. There was a light fog and a lot of moisture in the air, which made for a nice morning walk.</p>

             <p>We began a lengthy drive to Dresden, and stopped a few times along the way. When we got to Dresden, we first went to our hostel and had dinner. We left our hostel after dinner and took a tour around the city, and we were then given some free time to explore ourselves.</p>

             <p>Our main attraction of this morning was a bit more depressing than the others. We visited the concentration camp of Dachau, where over 200,000 people were imprisoned and 42,000 died. This was the first concentration camp that was set up, and was originally for political prisoners. It served as a model to the many other concentration camps that were erected all over Germany and the surrounding countries. As we solemnly walked to the enterance gate, we were greeted by the words:</p>
             <h2>"ARBEIT MACHT FREI"</h2>
             <p>This translates to, "Work brings Freedom". This is a tragically ironic notion, because many of the prisoners in this camp were forced to work until their death. It wasn't until April 29, 1945 that American troops liberated the surviving prisoners. The camp was in use for twelve years.</p>

             <img src="images/dachau12.jpg" class="ui large bordered rounded image">
             <p>The electric fence surrounding the camp has a high enough voltage to kill anyone who touches it on contact. For some, this fate was better than enduring the tortures of life inside.</p>

             <img src="images/dachau5.jpg" class="ui large bordered rounded image">
             <p>The barracks were tiny, and were always packed over capacity.</p>
             <img src="images/dachau2.jpg" class="ui large bordered rounded image">
             <p>Perhaps the most chilling part of the camp was the crematorium.</p>
             <img src="images/dachau16.jpg" class="ui large bordered rounded image">
             <p>Nazi propoganda was displayed throought the museum. The Nazis built up hate against Jewish people, and made out Hitler to be some sort of solution to all of Germany's problems.</p>

             <p>The words mean: "For the dead to honor, for the living to remember." Memorials like these could be found scattered all over the area. The dead in this camp are especially honored because many of them were those who spoke out against the Nazis and tried to stop what was happening.</p>
             
             <p>Inside the camp was a large museum describing the eintire Nazi regime and the part Dachau played in it. This museum was interesting, but also very depressing. We also visited the living quarters, which were cramped and clearly uncomfortable. We visited the crematorium too. It was eerie being in a place where thousands of people were tortured and died. But the camp and the memorial site Send a powerful message:</p>
             <h3>"MAY THE EXAMPLE OF THOSE WHO WERE EXTERMINATED HERE BETWEEN 1933-1945 BECAUSE THEY RESISTED NAZISM UNITE THE LIVING FOR THE DEFENCE OF PEACE AND FREEDOM AND IN RESPECT FOR THEIR FELLOW MEN"</h3>

             <p>We left the camp around midday and went to get some food. Then, we began our drive to Rothenberg. We drove in the bus for about five hours, but the drive was certainly worth it to see this town. Despite being very small, Rothenberg is a ity that is famous worldwide. It is over 900 years old, and was a strong medival city. However, due to an invasion, it was partially destroyed and many residents were killed. Thus, the once powerful city lived in poverty and could not build new buildings. As such, all buildings remained in the medival style to this day. The city is perfectly preserved in the medival style. Here are some pictures I took of the city.</p>

             <p>Fortunatley we woke up to some nicer weather today. We left the hostel early to go and see some of the various attractions that can be found in München, and we learned about it's historical significance. After that we were given some time to explore ourselves and have lunch, and I naturally had the German classic known as "Currywurst". This dish consists of a delicious sausage covered in curry sauce and served with Pommes (French Fries, Chips). I took some nice pictures of the city too, but it was still a bit cloudy.</p>

             <p>Today we also visited the BMW museum. This museum was very well done. It was modern, elegant, and very informative. I especially enjoyed the "Mini Story" exhibit, which explains the evolution of BMW's popular car brand, the Mini.</p>

             <p>We went back to the same hostel today, and relaxed for a bit. Then we all went together to a bar, where we once again had a few drinks and danced. After a few hours of enjoying the bar and plenty of loud latin music, we walked back to the Hostel and went to sleep.</p>
