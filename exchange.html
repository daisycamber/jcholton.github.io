                 <p>I've been messing around with the code of my site/blog as you may have noticed. I've split this personal essay collecton into a series of pages for easier reading. I've also decreased some of the image quality so the site will load faster. If any of you reading this would like one of the images in full definition and unedited (that's 16 megapixels), just send me an email using jasper(at)holton(dot)io. All of my images are in the public domain, meaning you can do whatever you like with them.</p>
                 <p>Additionally, I added a comments section (hopefully it works well) so feel <a href="#comments">feel free to leave a comment</a> on what you think. Once again, constructive criticism is welcome.</p>
                 <img src="images/comments.png" class="ui large bordered rounded image">
                 <p>Being as vacation is over, I'll be headed back to school tomorrow. I'll spend four hours in the school, and then go by train to Dusseldorf where I will spend another four hours in the Language school. It will most likley be exhausting, but I'll learn a lot and improve my German so I think it's worth it.</p>
                 <p>Lastly, I may have broke a few things when tweaking the site. If something doesn't work for you, once again please contact me so I can fix it. Thanks for reading!</p>
                 <p><b>Update: October 19, 2015</b> - I didn't figure this merit's a new entry, but I also added a essay archive so you can easily get to older essays or ones from a specific day. You can find this by clicking the "Archive" button on the meun bar.</p>

             <h2 class="ui header">Deutschland Tour: Day Fourteen</h2>
             <p><img src="images/me.jpg" class="ui avatar image"> <b>Jasper Holton</b> | October 16, 2015</p>
             <p>We woke up early for our last day of the tour, much to the protest of the very tired partiers of the night before. We were on the road at 8:30, and we drove directly to Münster, only stopping along the way for food. We said our goodbyes to those who lived near Münster, and then continued on to Duisburg where the greater portion of us live. We were sad to part ways after having such a great time together, but it won't be long until we see eachother again.</p>
             <p>I rode the train back to Wesel, where I found myself with a 20 minute walk home in the rain. Luckily one of my souveneirs from berlin happend to be an Umbrella, so I managed to deflect most of the weather and got home safe and dry.</p>
             <p>Deutschland tour is now over, but what I took from it lives on. I brought back with me many great memories, experiences, friendships, and photographs. And I have essays here as well. While I know my exchange has many more great things in store for me, this tour is certainly something I will not forget.</p>
             <p>As it is only now that I have received them, I have placed below all of the group pictures we took through the trip. Thanks to all of you for being an awesome tour group!</p>

             <p><img src="images/me.jpg" class="ui avatar image"> <b>Jasper Holton</b> | October 15, 2015</p>
             <p>We began our day with a short tour of the city and the harbor.</p>
             <img src="images/hamburg1-6.jpg" class="ui large bordered rounded image">

             <img src="images/hamburg1-11.jpg" class="ui large bordered rounded image">
             <p>After this short tour, we walked a short ways to the "Miniatur Wunderland". This is essentially a series of hyperrealistic models of cities in Germany and other parts of the world. It happens to be the largest model railroad in the world. Being a model railroad kind of guy, I really loved this place. Everything moved, from the trains to the cars to the planes. You will notice in the photos below that there was even a day/night cycle, with the lights turning dark for the night. It was really well done.</p>
             <img src="images/hamburg1-13.jpg" class="ui large bordered rounded image">
             <p>It is neccesary to expain that the photo above is at Checkpoint Charlie <a href="#checkpointcharlie">(remember this?)</a> and shows a scene from the unification of Germany, where it was no longer split up and became simply one nation. This historic and wonderful moment is beautifully represented in the scene.</p>

             <p>(Above) I should note that this photo is of the control room for all of the trains. These guys work all day just making sure these things don't crash into eachother or break. What a cool job.</p>

             <p>(Above) And of course, with a setup this complex, they have to have people to repair things. But all in all, the whole place was pretty much seamless. I never saw any major malfunction, like a stopped train or a broken light.</p>
             <p>We spent several hours in the Miniatur Wunderland, before continuing on with our tour of the city.</p>
             <img src="images/hamburg1-28.jpg" class="ui large bordered rounded image">

             <img src="images/hamburg1-30.jpg" class="ui large bordered rounded image">
             <p>We then continued to tour the city, and spent some time in the Rathaus. While the city was really nice, the weather was unfortunatley not so nice. Still, it was quite enjoyable.</p>
             <!---I might have mentioned this before, but Rotex (our tour organizers) made a rule that for each minute we were late, we would be required to pay one euro. They also made us pay 15 euros any time we were caught in groups of less than three. They pooled this money (of which I made a three euro contribution for my accidentally slightly longer stay at the East Side Gallery) and saved it for our last night of the tour. That night happened to be on this day. Rotex took us with our bus to a small bar in Hamburg, where they bought us drinks with the money we paid them for our lateness. We enjoyed our time at the bar, and reflected on our experiences over the course of the tour. We didn't go back with the bus, and instead walked to the train station and took two trains to get back to our hostel. This made for quite a long walk, but it seemed that this was a logical decision for Rotex and our bus driver because they weren't keen to have anyone vomiting on the bus. Fortunatley, we didn't run into this problem and all got back to the hostel just fine.</p>--->

             <p><img src="images/me.jpg" class="ui avatar image"> <b>Jasper Holton</b> | October 14, 2015</p>
             <p>Today we woke up early and began our long drive to our final tour destination, Hamburg. However, we didn't go directly to Hamburg. Instead, we took a break in the middle to explore a little bit of Schwerin. The castle here was really incredible, and we were able to explore the inside and some of the area around it. However, we weren't allowed to take any pictures inside the castle. The pictures I got really don't do it justice, but it was a really nice castle.</p>

             <p>After our time in Schwerin, we continued our drive to Hamburg. When we got there, we were given some time to unwind in a large park. We all enjoyed it, but our time was cut short as it began to rain. We met and drove with our bus to the Hauptkirche in Hamburg, where we had some time to walk around this fabulous church and take photos.</p>

             <p>After this, we went to our Hostel, had dinner, and settled into our rooms. We then were given some free time to walk around outside of our hostel, and I sat with a group of other exchange students in a nearby park, talking and enjoying the evening. We went back to the hostel at around 11 and went to bed.</p>

             <p>We continued our tour of Berlin today. We walked around and looked at some of the famous sites, including the Brandenburger Gate and the holocaust memorial. The Brandenburger gate is one of the most famous sites in Germany, and is on the back of the 20 Euro cent coin.</p>

             <p>After visiting the memorial, we went to the U.S. Checkpoint Charlie (Checkpoint C) which was an important point along the Berlin wall. This was where people could cross between the area of Germany under American control and the area under Soviet control.</p>
             <img src="images/berlin2-7.jpg" class="ui large bordered rounded image">

We then met back at the Hostel and walked to the Brandenburg Gate, which was lit up really nicley. We watched the show for a few minutes, which consisted of music and many interesting animations on the gate. Photos, and a video are below.</p>

             <p>We then walked to the Parliment building where we were given a tour and a short lecture about the building and the government. We were given some time to explore in the building, which was really nice. All of the architecture was modern and really beautiful.</p>

             <p>We were given a bit more time to sleep today, which was nice. We woke up, packed, had breakfast and then boarded our bus for the drive to this nation's beautiful and historic capital of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin" target="_blank">Berlin</a>. In Berlin, we drove around and saw some of the major sites in the city via our bus.</p>

             <p>One of my favourite parts about this tour was the East Side Gallery, which is a gallery of street art. It has many truly beautiful pieces of art which are famous across the world.</p>

             <p>When our tour was over, we went back to the hostel and settled into our rooms. Then we went out to a restaurant for dinner. After finishing dinner, we went to a beautiful light show where massive projectors projected art onto some of the famous buildings in Berlin. Below are some of the best displays.</p>

             <p>This light show was really incredible. I had never seen anything like it. What a creative idea to light up buildings with massive projectors and turn them into beautiful, dynamic art. After we were done watching this light show, we went back to our hostel and went to bed.</p>

             <p>Today was our second day in Dresden. We had another tour of the city, and once again more free time to explore the city. Today was dreadfully cold for many of the exchange students. It was about 0 Celsius, which for me doesn't seem bad at all, but for many of the exchange students coming from other countries it was much colder than they are used to. Despite the cold, we all had a good time and enjoyed this beautiful city. Naturally, pictures are below.</p>

             <p>After our free time, we met and were all picked up by our bus driver. We took a short drive to the Meisen Porcelain factory. This factory was the first making porcelain in all of Europe, and does it incredibly well. Everything they make is handmade and hand painted. And all of it is way beyond anything I can afford. A little teacup? Five hundered euros. A nice little plate? Nine hundered. A little angel statue? Two thousand. Despite this, it was nice to look around and take some pictures. These people really know their stuff when it comes to Porcelain.</p>

             <img src="images/dresden2-10.jpg" class="ui large bordered rounded image">
             <p>After touring the museum and workshop, we visited the gift shop. I was thinking some nice porcelain from a historic place would make a great present, but once again I discovered that the cheapest little bit of porcelain costs 30 euros, which is way beyond my price range. So instead we headed back out into the cold day, now a bit warmer after a good few hours of sunshine. We drove back to our hostel where we had dinner, and then some free time to prepare for the talent show that the tour organizers were putting on for us. I decided to make an attempt to sing "Here's a Health to the Company", which I found to be a very fitting song for our tour group. I even got my audience to join me for the Chorous, which was really wonderful.</p>
             <p></p>
             <p>After the talent show, which proved to be equal parts hastily prepared and hilarious, we all went to sleep.</p>
